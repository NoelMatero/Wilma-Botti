A product made to ease the process of picking courses in Wilma. The idea was to send requests to Wilma which then would choose the courses for the student before any other student. 

The product saw varying results with some customers having all of their courses picked in a fraction of a second, but with some having only a couple of courses picked. 

The product was tested before the course selection becamoe open and it worked perfectly. One possible issue could have been Wilmas servers. 

The source code has been lost.
